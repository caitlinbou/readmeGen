## Description
This program uses Node.js with the  inquirer npm package to prompt a series of questions in the terminal with the purpose of generating a quality readme to use with your own projects. Please follow the video link in the USAGE section for a quick walk through.

## Installation
This program requires that you install Node.js. From there, you must generate a package.json for the folder in which you are working. Do this with the "npm init" command. Next, run "npm install inquirer". Both the questions.js as well as the index.js files are required.
## Usage 
Once your installs are completed and all files are present, simply launch the terminal and type the command "node fileName.js". Answer the prompts with the verbiage you wish to have for your readme. Make any necessary edits directly within the resulting file.
